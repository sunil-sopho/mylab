		<h1>Welcome to The Beginning</h1>
		<p>Hello! I'm Divyanshu Saxena, CSE undergraduate at IIT Delhi. I've prepared this site for the Development Club assignment. It has been a great deal of work to finalise this website. Although, it was given to me as an assignment, just like many others, still I feel that this site, this very site, can be my first step towards becoming a good developer. All such developing tasks interest me a lot and I have always wished to be able to work upon such things. So, here's my first webpage. I hope you like it!!</p>

		<p>Yeah! That's me obviously. As already mentioned earlier, I'm presently a first year student at IIT Delhi, pursuing B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm basically from Lucknow and my hobbies include listening to songs, reading books and dancing.</p>  
		<p>Now that I've told you about myself, I would also like to know something about you. I request you to please fill up the questions given below.</p>
		{% if q_list %}
			<ul>
			{% for question in q_list %}
				<li> <a href="/Assn/{{question.id}}">{{question.ques_text}}</a></li>
			{% endfor %}
			</ul>
		{% else %}
			<p>Thank you for sharing the information.</p>
